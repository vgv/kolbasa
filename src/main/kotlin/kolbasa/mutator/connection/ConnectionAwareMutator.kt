/**
 * Base interface for all mutators that must work in context of already opened transaction.
 *
 * Mutators are used to change existing messages in the queues, for example, adjust visibility timeout, remaining attempts etc.
 *
 * Sometimes it is useful to mutate messages in context of already opened and externally managed transaction.
 *
 * For example, if you are using Hibernate, Exposed, Spring JDBC Template or another framework (even plain JDBC), you may
 * want to mutate messages in a queue and update the database in a single transaction.
 *
 * For example, you have a pending order for which you need to regularly check the payment status in a
 * third-party system. You receive a message from the `check_order_status` queue, check the order status and, if the
 * status is the same, you want to mark the time of the last check of the order in the `sale` table and, if the number
 * of attempts is over, just add a little more. If the order is paid, then just delete the message from the queue
 * because the task is completed, everything is processed.
 *
 * If the transaction will be rolled back, the message will not be deleted from the `check_order_status` queue and
 * your `sale` table won't be updated, allowing you to retry the entire operation later.
 * Otherwise, both operations will be committed.
 *
 * You don't need to handle this manually, this connection aware mutator will do it for you. All you need - provide
 * current active JDBC connection to every `mutate` method.
 *
 * In case of Hibernate, it may look like this
 * ```
 * session.doWork { connection ->
 *    consumer.receive(queue)?.let { message ->
 *       val orderIsPaid = << request to 3rd-party system >>
 *       if (!orderIsPaid) {
 *          // Update the business entity inside the same transaction
 *          sale.status = 'UNPAID'
 *          sale.lastChecked = LocalDateTime.now()
 *          session.update(sale)
 *
 *          // add remaining attempts to prolongate message life inside the same transaction
 *          if (message.remainingAttempts == 0) {
 *             mutator.addRemainingAttempts(connection, queue, 10, message.id)
 *          }
 *       } else {
 *          // Update the business entity inside the same transaction
 *          sale.status = 'PAID'
 *          session.update(sale)
 *
 *          // order is paid, let's delete the processed message inside the same transaction
 *          consumer.delete(connection, queue, message)
 *       }
 *    }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When Hibernate commits transaction (explicitly or, for example, when you use `@Transactional` annotation), your business
 * entity changes and message mutation will be commited at the same time.
 *
 * The same ideas work for producers or consumers too â€“ you can build completely transactional pipeline just by connecting
 * a few producers/consumers/mutators into one "chain" using the same connection and work inside one active transaction.
 *
 * Kolbasa provides a default, high-performance implementation of [ConnectionAwareMutator]
 * (see [ConnectionAwareDatabaseMutator]), which uses just plain JDBC and doesn't require any additional dependencies.
