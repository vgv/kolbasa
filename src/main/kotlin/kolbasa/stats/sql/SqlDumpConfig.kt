     * 1) This library doesn't do any synchronization around this writer. All threads just use this 'writer' instance
     * without synchronization. If your 'writer' implementation isn't thread-safe â€“ please, take care of that yourself.
     * 2) 'flush' is called after every query dumped. If you need to dump a lot of queries it can cause performance
     * degradation. In this case, you need to implement a more sophisticated Writer with custom 'flush' behaviour (like
     * internal buffering and do real flush at every 1000th invocation or something like this)
