     * to PostgreSQL. Instead, it splits the list into chunks of size [batchSize] and sends one INSERT statement
     * per chunk. So, if you send 10,000 messages using one producer.send() call and [batchSize] is 500, kolbasa
     * will only make 20 calls to the database.
     *
     * 2) Failure granularity.
     * Batch size helps you to control how big (or small) has to be a 'failure' chunk. See [PartialInsert] for details.

     * Shard number.
     *
     * If you are using Kolbasa Cluster and have multiple PostgreSQL servers, messages will be distributed among these servers
     * in a non-deterministic, unknown manner. However, in some cases, it may be useful to control how messages are
     * distributed across the servers. The two most common scenarios are:
     * 1) Deduplication using unique meta fields. Kolbasa uses unique PostgreSQL indexes for deduplication, but unique indexes
     *    do not work across multiple database servers. Therefore, messages must be on the same server for this to work correctly.
     * 2) Enforcing message order when reading. For example, you want to put messages with specific `account_id` and read them
     *    later in the same order (by another field or just time of sending). You can use filtering by `account_id` and sorting
     *    by required field (fields), but, if messages are not on the same server, you can't have an order guarantee. To ensure
     *    correct ordering, you must ensure that messages with the same `account_id` are on the same server.
     *
     * To control message persistence on specific servers in the cluster shard field should be used.
     * Kolbasa guarantees that messages with the same shard value will be stored on the same server. The shard value can be any
     * integer from [Int.MIN_VALUE] to [Int.MAX_VALUE]. For Kolbasa itself, the specific shard value carries no inherent
     * meaning â€” it is arbitrary and determined by your business logic. The only guarantee is that messages with the same shard
     * will persist on the same server. Messages with different shard values may be stored on the same server or on different
     * ones, without any guarantee.
