    // example, new meta fields were added or other internal schema changes occurred. This is a convenient method that allows
    // you not to think about whether this queue has been used before or this is the first time and simply brings its state
    // in the database to the current one.
    // Of course, in a real application this should be done once at the start of the service, and not before each send/receive.

    // methods - this should be done once at the start of the service, and not before each SQL query from these tables.
